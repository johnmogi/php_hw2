INSERT INTO customers (CustomerID, ContactName, companyName, Phone) VALUES ("ABCDF", "John5", "Pardes ", "050-dfgdf")

done!

fixed many errors in requests queries:

main issues:

1. customerID should be a string.
2. companyName is a required field (checked under structure for null = no)

3. update - ask assaf how to retrieve fields into the form before update with select button and or into the fields happy times (:
