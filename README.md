INSERT INTO customers (CustomerID, ContactName, Address, Phone) VALUES ("ABCDF", "John5", "Pardes ", "050-dfgdf")

done!

fixed many errors in requests queries:

main issues:

1. customerID should be a string.
2. companyName is a required field (checked under structure for null = no)

happy times (:
